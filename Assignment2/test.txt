while in kyoto i tried to learn japanese with 
a vengeance i worked much harder at it and got 
to a point where i could go around in taxis and 
do things i took lessons from a japanese man every 
day for an hour 
 
one day he was teaching me the word for see all right 
he said you want to say may i see your garden what 
do you say
 
i made up a sentence with the word that i had just 
learned
 
no no he said when you say to someone would you 
like to see my garden you use the first see but 
when you want to see someone elses garden you 
must use another see which is more polite
 
would you like to glance at my lousy garden is 
essentially what youre saying in the first case 
but when you want to look at the other fellas garden 
you have to say something like may i observe your 
gorgeous garden so theres two different words 
you have to use 
 
then he gave me another one you go to a temple 
and you want to look at the gardens
 
i made up a sentence this time with the polite see
 
no no he said in the temple the gardens are much 
more elegant so you have to say something that 
would be equivalent to may i hang my eyes on 
your most exquisite gardens 

three or four different words for one idea 
because when im doing it its miserable when youre 
doing it its elegant 

i was learning japanese mainly for technical things 
so i decided to check if this same problem existed 
among the scientists 

at the institute the next day i said to the guys 
in the office how would i say in japanese i solve 
the dirac equation 

they said such and so 

ok now i want to say would you solve the dirac equation
how do i say that

well you have to use a different word for solve they say 

why i protested when i solve it i do the same damn 
thing as when you solve it 
well yes but its a different word its more polite
i gave up i decided that wasnt the language for me
and stopped learning japanese
